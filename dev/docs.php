        <h2> Why PulsePHP:</h2>
        PulsePHP is an excellent choice for building web-based applications because it offers several features that make development faster and easier.

        <h2>MVC:</h2>
        The MVC pattern is an architectural design pattern that separates an application into three key components: Model, View, and Controller. The Model is responsible for managing data, the View is responsible for rendering the user interface, and the Controller is responsible for handling user input and interactions. By separating these components, PulsePHP allows for easier development, better organization, and easier maintenance of your code.
